/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for a tax management system.

 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 *  - /users/{userId}/taxYears/{taxYearId}: Stores tax years for a specific user.
 *  - /users/{userId}/taxYears/{taxYearId}/incomes/{incomeId}: Stores income records for a specific tax year.
 *  - /users/{userId}/taxYears/{taxYearId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense records for a specific tax year.
 *  - /users/{userId}/documents/{documentId}: Stores document metadata for a specific user.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *  - No user listing is allowed.
 *  - All data is private and requires authentication.
 *  - The rules enforce that the authenticated user ID matches the user ID in the data paths.
