/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the tax management system.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring data isolation between users.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with the document ID matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/taxYears/{taxYearId}: Stores tax years for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/taxYears/{taxYearId}/incomes/{incomeId}: Stores income records for each tax year.
 * - /users/{userId}/taxYears/{taxYearId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense records for each tax year.
 * - /users/{userId}/documents/{documentId}: Stores document metadata for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own data.
 * - Listing of documents is allowed within a user's own collections.
 * - No global admin roles are defined, simplifying the security model.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  The `userId` field is present in all subcollections, enabling simple ownership checks without additional `get()` calls.
