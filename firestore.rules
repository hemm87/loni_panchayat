/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Loni Panchayat Tax Management System.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and a data-driven role-based access control for properties and tax records.
 * Users can only manage their own profiles. Access to property and tax records is determined by the user's role and property ownership.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.  The document ID is the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /properties/{propertyId}: Stores property records. `ownerSystemId` links to the UserProfile document.
 * - /properties/{propertyId}/tax_records/{taxRecordId}: Stores tax records for a specific property.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are private to the user and admins.
 * - Properties are accessible to owners and admins.
 * - Tax records follow the access control of their parent property.
 * - Listing properties and tax records can be secured based on user role or ownership.
 * - User roles are stored directly in the UserProfile document.
